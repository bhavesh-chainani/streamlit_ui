## Enhancing Urban Food Resilience through Climate-Smart Agriculture: A Comprehensive Research Proposal

### 1. General Information

Singapore, as a highly urbanized and land-scarce city-state, faces unique challenges in ensuring long-term food security amidst growing climate uncertainties. With over 90% of its food imported, the nation remains vulnerable to global supply chain disruptions, extreme weather events, and geopolitical tensions.

In response, Singapore has committed to strengthening its agri-food resilience through innovative and sustainable approaches, including the “30 by 30” goal—aiming to produce 30% of its nutritional needs locally by 2030.

This research project, titled **“Enhancing Urban Food Resilience through Climate-Smart Agriculture in Singapore: A Multi-pronged Approach,”** seeks to contribute meaningfully to this national agenda. Led by SIT, and supported by a consortium of esteemed collaborators including **A*STAR – Singapore Food Agency (SFA)** and **Wageningen University & Research (WUR)**, the project will explore and implement climate-smart agricultural strategies tailored to Singapore’s urban context.

Over a period of **three years**, and with a funding request of **SGD 2.5 million**, this initiative will adopt a multi-disciplinary and systems-based approach. It will integrate advanced technologies, data-driven decision-making, and community engagement to develop scalable models for urban farming that are resilient to climate variability.

The project will also assess the socio-economic and environmental impacts of these models, ensuring that proposed solutions are not only technically viable but also socially inclusive and ecologically sustainable.

By leveraging cross-institutional expertise and international best practices, this research aims to position Singapore as a global leader in urban food resilience and climate-smart agriculture.

### 2. Scientific Abstract of the Proposal

This project addresses the critical challenge of ensuring food security in Singapore amidst the growing threats of climate change and global supply chain disruptions.

By focusing on the development and implementation of advanced, climate-resilient vertical farming systems, the project aims to significantly enhance Singapore's capacity for sustainable local food production.

These systems will integrate cutting-edge technologies, including AI-driven crop monitoring, precision irrigation, and renewable energy integration, to optimize yield, nutritional value, and resource efficiency under projected climate change scenarios.

The project leverages the combined expertise of A*STAR, SIT, SFA, and WUR to create a holistic, impactful, and scalable solution that directly contributes to Singapore’s “30 by 30” food security goal.

This research will not only develop technological solutions but also analyze the economic feasibility, social acceptance, and policy implications of widespread vertical farming adoption in Singapore.
