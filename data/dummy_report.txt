### 1. 🧬 Introduction
- Singapore has seen a rise in age-related chronic illnesses such as Type 2 Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease.  
- Current research focuses on predictive diagnostics and health data monitoring.  
- However, early detection and real-time intervention capabilities remain limited.

### 3. 🧪 Methodology
- **Study Design:** A three-phase mixed-method prospective cohort:  
  1. **Phase I (Bench Testing):** Calibration and analytical validation of the electrochemical sensor array.  
  2. **Phase II (Pilot Deployment):** 50 healthy volunteers wear the device for 2 months to refine usability and data capture.  
  3. **Phase III (Field Trial):** 200 participants (100 Type 2 Diabetes, 100 high cardiovascular risk) monitored over 12 months in a prospective observational cohort.

- **Experimental Workflow:**  
  1. Device fabrication (flexible electrochemical sensor + Bluetooth module)  
  2. Bench testing (sensitivity/specificity vs. lab assays)  
  3. Clinical pilot (wearable on volunteers; continuous data logging)  
  4. Algorithm development (signal preprocessing → feature extraction → model training)  
  5. Validation against gold-standard blood biomarker measurements.

- **Data Plan:**  
  - Raw sensor streams via Bluetooth to AWS IoT Core.  
  - Preprocessing: noise filtering using Python (SciPy).  
  - Feature extraction: time- and frequency-domain metrics.  
  - Modeling: Random Forest and SVM in scikit-learn, evaluated by RMSE and Pearson’s correlation against lab assays.
